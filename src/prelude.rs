/*! Crate prelude

# Usage

```rust
use tear::prelude::*;
```

# Description

Simplifies importing every symbol needed for the macros to work.

It exports the following symbols:

- ValRet and its variants Val and Ret
- Looping
- `tear!`, `terror!` and `twist!` macros
- The useful `tear_if!` and `anybox!` macros
- `next_if!` and `last_if` because they're unlikely to conflict
- (f=experimental) `impl_judge_from_try!`

It also brings the Judge and Return traits into scope as they are required for the macros to work.
However, they are not imported as symbols.
